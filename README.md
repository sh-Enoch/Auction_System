###  Project Walkthrough

1. Users register and authenticate using JWT.
2. Authenticated users can:

   * List an item for auction with images.
   * Browse all active auctions.
   * Place and update bids on items.
3. API is cleanly structured using `ninja-extra` for clear separation of concerns.

---

### What I Learned

This project has been an excellent learning experience. I deepened my understanding of:

* Structuring clean REST APIs using Django Ninja & ninja-extra.
* Writing modular, testable backend code with layered architecture.
* Managing static/media files in Django.
* Handling real-world dev issues like Git merge conflicts and `.gitignore` hygiene.
* Planning a full-stack app workflow with a clear API-first development strategy.

---

### üîÆ Future Improvements

* [ ] Complete frontend UI with Tailwind and Next.js
* [ ] Real-time bidding (via WebSockets or polling)
* [ ] User dashboard with auction history and wins
* [ ] Email notifications on auction status
* [ ] Deployment to Vercel (frontend) and Render or Railway (backend)
